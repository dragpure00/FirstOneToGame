# FirstOneToGame

My First attempt at making a  simple game based on Java. The premise of this is to have two or more players start at 50 points and roll
a dice to get a random value. The value will substract from 50 and until they hit 1 and thus they win and the program ends. 

if A player ends up getting a roll that earns them having less than 1 point then that roll will instead add to the total. 
It is possible that the game will end with a tie.
